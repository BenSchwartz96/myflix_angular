# MyFlixAngular
This is a portfolio project. It's the bones of a website where one could find information about movies, directors, and genres, and register their own favorites.
Live demo [_here_](https://benschwartz96.github.io/myflix_angular/welcome).


## General Information
- This app currently only has basic functionality, and crucially is missing a fully populated database of movies to draw from. 


## Features
- Make an account and edit your profile
- Add or remove favorite movies to your profile.
- Find out, for each movie, who the director was and what the genres are.

## Technologies

- Angular
- Typescript
- HTML
- CSS
- Javascript, Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and Mongoose for the API
- Typedoc


## Project Status
Project is complete. Though it is very basic, setting up the basic functionality in order to learn the relevant concepts (most notably the Angular framework in this case) was the central goal of the project. Further improvements or polishes may be made.
